# [Driver Drowsiness Detection Using Mediapipe In Python](https://learnopencv.com/driver-drowsiness-detection-using-mediapipe-in-python/)

Create a Driver Drowsiness Detection and Alerting System using Mediapipe’s Face Mesh solution API in Python. These systems assess the driver’s alertness and warn the driver if needed.

This is an approach that does not use Deep Learning for the detection of drowsiness, but uses the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) technique, therefore a simple formula. The idea is to provide a real-time service to the driver, as otherwise it would be quite useless, for this reason our initial idea is to use a lighter system for this task, in order to use deep learning for the driver distraction detection task.
